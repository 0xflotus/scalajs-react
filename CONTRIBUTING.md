In order to preserve the quality and maintainability of this project
please ensure the following when submitting a PR:

#### Style
Eventually I will automate this. For now please bear with me.
* Look at the spaces and indentation of surrounding code and match it. Usually just getting your IDE to auto-format will be fine.
* Explicitly declare return types on new methods.

#### Tests
* Add unit tests for new features or changes.

#### Documentation
* Update the current changelog in `doc/changelog`
* Add/update documentation to the relevant file in `doc/`.
