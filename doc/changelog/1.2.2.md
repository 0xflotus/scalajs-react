## 1.2.2

* Add ability to create JsFnComponents from Scala (without boxing props).
  New methods:

  ```scala
  // High-level

  JsFnComponent.create             [P <: js.Object](props             => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.create.withChildren[P <: js.Object]((props, children) => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.create.justChildren                (children          => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.create.byName                      (                  => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.create.const                       (                     VdomElement)

  // Low-level

  JsFnComponent.fromFn  [P <: js.Object](P with raw.Children => raw.React.Element)
  JsFnComponent.fromJsFn[P <: js.Object](js.Function1[P with raw.Children, raw.React.Element])
  ```

* Bugfix: In `Broadcaster` in extra, the `unregister` function would actually make the subject the sole listener
  rather than remove it. Unfortunately there was a bug in μTest which let this slip through the gaps.
  Versions affected: 1.2.[0-1].
