## 1.2.2

* Add ability to create JsFnComponents from Scala fns (without boxing props).
  New methods:

  ```scala
  // High-level

  JsFnComponent.fromScala             [P <: js.Object](props             => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.withChildren[P <: js.Object]((props, children) => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.justChildren                (children          => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.byName                      (                  => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromScala.const                       (                     VdomElement)

  // Low-level

  JsFnComponent.fromScala.generic[P <: js.Object, C <: Children](P with RAW.PropsWithChildren => VdomElement)
  JsFnComponent.fromJsFn         [P <: js.Object, C <: Children](js.Function1[P with raw.Children, raw.React.Element])
  ```

* Add ability to create a `JsFnComponent` by wrapping an existing component.
  The target component's props either need to be a subtype of `js.Object` or a known singleton like `Unit` or `Null`.
  Example:

  ```scala
  val scalaComponent = ScalaComponent.builder[String]("")
    .render_P(name => <.div("My name is: ", name))
    .build

  // These will be the props object used from JS-land
  trait JsProps extends js.Object {
    val name: String
  }

  val jsComponent = JsFnComponent.toComponent(scalaComponent.cmapCtorProps[JsProps](_.name))

  // Pass .raw to your JS devs for use in JSX or whatever
  jsComponent.raw
  ```

* Bugfix: In `Broadcaster` in extra, the `unregister` function would actually make the subject the sole listener
  rather than remove it. Unfortunately there was a bug in μTest which let this slip through the gaps.
  Versions affected: 1.2.[0-1].
