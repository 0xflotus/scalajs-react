## 0.10.5 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/compare/v0.10.4...v0.10.5)) (UNRELEASED)

* Changed order and constraints of type params of `japgolly.scalajs.react.extra.router.StaticDsl.RouteCommon`.
* Add to `extra.router`'s `Route[A]`:
  * `.pmap[B](A => Option[B])(B => A): Route[B]`
  * `.pmapL[B](Prism[A, B]): Route[B]`
* Increase and improve `Router` logging. (Still off by default. Remember to use `.logToConsole` to enable.)
* Add auto-correction to routes. See [Loose routes with auto-correction](../ROUTER.md#loose-routes-with-auto-correction).
* Router `Rule#action` changed from `Page => Option[Action[Page]]` to `(Path, Page) => Option[Action[Page]]`.
* Add new Router DSL:
  * `remainingPath` - Captures the (non-empty) remaining portion of the URL path.
  * `remainingPathOrBlank` - Captures the (potentially-empty) remaining portion of the URL path.
* Add `ReactTestVar` to `test` module that can be used to mock the following types in tests:
  * `CompState.Access[A]`
  * `ExternalVar[A]`
  * `ReusableVar[A]`
  [Example.](../TESTING.md#reacttestvar)
