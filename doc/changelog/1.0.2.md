## v1.0.2

* Fix React warnings with SVG VDOM.

* Refactored `vdom.Builder` which is an internal mechanism for efficiently composing VDOM.
  There is now:
  * An interface - advanced users can create their own if they like
  * `vdom.Builder.ToVdomElement` - builds a `VdomElement` which was the previous default
  * `vdom.Builder.ToJs` - provides raw JS values like `props: js.Object` and more

* Opening links in new tabs using `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener` is a
  [security risk and performance impediment](https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2017/03/target-blank-links-rel-noopener-performance-security/).
  Google's Lighthouse auditor [flags it](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener).

  Two new methods have been introduced to scalajs-react that address this by default:

  * The anchor vdom tag (`<.a`) gained `.toNewWindow`:

      ```scala
      /** A link to open a new window (tab) to a given URL.
        *
        * Like: `<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>`
        *
        * @param noopener See https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener
        */
      def toNewWindow(href      : String,
                      noopener  : Boolean = true,
                      noreferrer: Boolean = false)
      ```

  * Added `CallbackTo.windowOpen`:
      ```scala
      /** When executed, opens a new window (tab) to a given URL.
        *
        * @param noopener See https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener
        * @param focus    Whether or not to focus the new window.
        */
      def windowOpen(url     : String,
                     noopener: Boolean = true,
                     focus   : Boolean = true): CallbackTo[Window] =
      ```
