## v1.0.2

* Fix React warnings with SVG VDOM.

* Refactored `vdom.Builder` which is an internal mechanism for efficiently composing VDOM.
  There is now:
  * An interface - advanced users can create their own if they like
  * `vdom.Builder.ToVdomElement` - builds a `VdomElement` which was the previous default
  * `vdom.Builder.ToJs` - provides raw JS values like `props: js.Object` and more
