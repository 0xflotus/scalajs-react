## v1.0.1

* Use new Scala.JS 0.6.17 annotations so that React facades JustWork when compiling to modules.
  `WebpackRequire` is no longer required and thus deprecated.
  You can also remove `expose-loader` from your scalajs-bundler config.

* Add `Reusability#reusable(A)` as a flipped alternative of `Reusable.explicitly(A)(Reusability)` that avoids
  annoying Scala type inference problems in certain situations.

* Upgrade
  * Scala.JS to 0.6.17
  * Scalaz to 7.2.13
  * scalajs-dom to 0.9.2
