## 1.3.0

* The `.getDOMNode` callback can sometimes execute when unmounted which is an increasingly annoying bug to track down
  since React 16 with its new burn-it-all-down error handling approach. This release adjusts the types to restore
  compile-time safety. Unfortunately it's a breaking change. There is now a proper ADT:

  ```
                  ComponentDom
                        ↑
               ComponentDom.Mounted
                  ↑            ↑
  ComponentDom.Element      ComponentDom.Text
  ```

  Within lifecycle calls. `.getDOMNode` returns a `ComponentDom.Mounted` logically equivalent to before,
  where as the `.getDOMNode` on a mounted / backend scope now returns `ComponentDom` which might not be mounted.
  See the source for all available methods but you'll typically call one of the following methods:

  ```scala
  trait ComponentDom {
    def mounted  : Option[ComponentDom.Mounted]
    def toElement: Option[dom.Element]
    def toText   : Option[dom.Text]
  ```

  In unit tests you'll typically use `asMounted().asElement()` or `asMounted().asText()` for inspection.

* React 16.3 support

    * React Context API implemented via `React.createContext` and `React.Context`.

    * Add `React.StrictMode`

    * New component lifecycle: `getDerivedStateFromProps`

    * New component lifecycle: `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`

* Adding support for `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` was quite disruptive and resulted in the following knock-on changes:
  * `.configure` in `ScalaComponent.builder` now only accepts one argument.
  * `ScalaComponent.Config` (used for externalising and reusing opaque component lifecycle logic) has changed from
     a bearable `type Config[P, C <: Children, S, B]` to the horrendous definition below. It's not something that
     many people use and even when they do it's infrequent, but hopefully a workaround can be found soon anyway.

     ```scala
     /** This is terrible and repulsive but Scala doesn't allow anything less repulsive.
       * We'll keep this correctly modelling the reality for now and soon see if maybe we can use macros to
       * simplify it's creation (and avoid the need to use this explicitly).
       */
     type Config[P, C <: Children, S, B, US <: UpdateSnapshot, US2 <: UpdateSnapshot]
     ```
  * `LogLifecycle` has been deleted without replacement

* Added to `ScalaComponent.builder`: `.configureWhen` and `.configureUnless`

* Deprecated `ReactFragment` and replaced with `React.Fragment`.

* Update dependencies:
    * Cats to 1.2.0

## Migration

```sh
find . -name '*.scala' -type f -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/ReactFragment/React.Fragment/g;
  ' {} +

find . -path '*/test/scala/*.scala' -type f -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/getDOMNode.asElement/getDOMNode.asMounted().asElement()/g;
  s/getDOMNode.asText/getDOMNode.asMounted().asText()/g;
  s/getDOMNode.domCast/getDOMNode.asMounted().domCast/g;
  ' {} +
```
