## 0.11.2 (unreleased)

* `.test.ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument` creates detached DOM meaning that focus doesn't work.
  Added alternative methods that render a component into `document.body` for testing.

  * `.renderIntoBody`
  * `.withRenderedIntoBody`
  * `.withRendered`

* Add to `.test.{Keyboard,Mouse}EventData`:

  ```scala
    def alt   = copy(altKey   = true)
    def ctrl  = copy(ctrlKey  = true)
    def meta  = copy(metaKey  = true)
    def shift = copy(shiftKey = true)
  ```
